#Set up environment and load data into R
```{r cache=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
setwd("~/Documents/R/NYPD_MVC/")
mvc.raw <- read.csv(file = "NYPD_Motor_Vehicle_Collisions.csv", header = T)
```

#Get info of the data
1. Use str() function 
```{r}
str(mvc.raw)
```
2. Use head() function
```{r}
head(mvc.raw)
```

*The NYPD_Motor_Vehicle_Collisions.csv has lots of empty entries and NAs in cells.
*Some columns are charactor but were assigned to factor.

#Clean up data
1. Reassign attributes columns
```{r}
mvc.raw$DATE <- as.Date(mvc.raw_NA$DATE, format = "%m/%d/%Y")

```

2. Use complete.case() function to remove cases having any NA in its cells
```{r}
mvc.del_NA <- complete.cases(mvc.raw)
```
